blend2csv.py generates csv files from meshes in a .blend file. These can be loaded by py-airfoil during the creation of its own meshes.

criticalCollider.py creates a ui control in blender to allow a user to specify that a mesh (only makes sense for spheres) is tagged as a collider.

gradient-from-image.scm is a blender script-fu plugin. It creates a gradient from a 1 pixel high cross-section of an image. Then by going to Colors -> Map -> Gradient Map we can colourise an image from this new gradiant. This proess will convert our grayscale terrain map bmp to colour to use as a texture in our hud.
